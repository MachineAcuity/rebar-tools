# Tools for managing Rebar and Universal Relay Boilerplate applications

The rebar tools are for managing [Rebar](https://github.com/MachineAcuity/rebar) applications.

## Requirements

* Works only on UNIX (Mac, Linux).
* Requires Node.js `12.13` or later.
* Output is optimized for terminals with dark background color.

## Installation

Run `npm install -g rebar-tools`.

Notice that because the tools use `nodegit` the installation might take a substantial amount of time, if it needs to be built for the specific version of Node.js you use.

## Usage

Run `rebar --help` to receive information about options.
